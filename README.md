# Software Defined Networks

### Python at Linux (Ubuntu)

## Description

(The topology is described in the output of the mininet run that can be seen in screenshots below.)

In this project I have developed a load balancer, which aims to reduce the load on the server, that there are several services that distribute the same service, only that the requests are randomly routed between the services and for a large number of requests, . At the end of the run, it will be possible to see a bar graph of the total number of requests received by each of the four services on the server.

There is a file in the project that explains how to run the task row by line to run it correctly ..


* Here are screenshots of the project:
